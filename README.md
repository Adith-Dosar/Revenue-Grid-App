# Revenue Grid Classification

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify customers into different revenue grids (e.g., low, medium, high revenue) using a classification model based on customer data and demographics. By accurately categorizing customers, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, personalize customer experiences, and optimize resource allocation to maximize revenue.

## Objectives
1. **Accurate Classification**: Develop a classification model that accurately categorizes customers into predefined revenue grids.
2. **Feature Analysis**: Identify and analyze the key features that significantly impact revenue classification.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Create an intuitive interface for users to input their data and receive classification results.
4. **Business Insights**: Provide insights into customer behavior and demographics to help businesses optimize their strategies.

## Key Features
1. **Customer Data**: Information about customer purchases, transaction history, and spending patterns.
2. **Demographics**: Age, gender, income level, education, and other demographic factors.
3. **Geographic Data**: Location, region, and other geographic information.
4. **Behavioral Data**: Customer behavior patterns, such as purchase frequency, average transaction value, and loyalty program participation.
5. **Historical Data**: Previous revenue data to train the model and improve classification accuracy.

## Data Collection
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Income**: Annual income of the customer.
- **Education**: Education level of the customer.
- **Location**: Geographic location of the customer.
- **Purchase History**: Historical data on customer purchases and transactions.
- **Loyalty Program**: Participation and activity in loyalty programs.
- **Revenue Grid**: The predefined revenue category (e.g., low, medium, high) for the customer.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the collected data, handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing the data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that might improve the model's performance, such as average transaction value or purchase frequency.
3. **Model Selection**: Experiment with different classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines, to find the best-performing model.
4. **Model Training**: Train the selected model using the preprocessed data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the model as a web application or API for users to access and use.

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Accurate Classification**: The model should accurately classify customers into predefined revenue grids.
2. **Insights into Customer Behavior**: Users will gain insights into which factors contribute most to revenue classification.
3. **Personalized Marketing**: Businesses can tailor their marketing strategies based on customer classification.
4. **Resource Optimization**: Help businesses optimize resource allocation and improve customer segmentation.

## Future Work
1. **Expand Feature Set**: Incorporate additional features such as social media activity, customer feedback, and real-time behavioral data.
2. **Improve Model Accuracy**: Continuously improve the model's accuracy by incorporating more data and refining the model.
3. **User Feedback**: Collect user feedback to improve the model and the user interface.
4. **Integration with Business Tools**: Integrate the model with CRM systems, marketing platforms, and other business tools for real-time classification and insights.
